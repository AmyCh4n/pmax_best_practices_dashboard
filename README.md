# pMax Best Practices Dashboard

  

## Problem Statement

  

Reporting for pMax campaigns is cumbersome and advertisers need a simple way to see an overview of their accounts and get a clear picture of their assets's performance in their pmax campaigns.

  

## Solution

  

The pMax Dashboard is a LookerStudio dashboard providing an overview of your accounts' pmax campaigns' performance and the assets uploaded. Feedback is provided as to whether the campaigns comply with the best practice guidelines for the number and type of assets uploaded.  Moreover, assets' performance is displayed and conveniently presented so advertisers can refresh poorly performing assets.
